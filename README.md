## Description:
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">JOY ACROSS BORDERS 🔥🔥😵‍💫</mark> is a interactive platform meant to serve information regarding every country for every type of human from vacation travelers to rogue individuals seeking asylum in foreign land. Our vision of the site is to create an interactive map where clicking on any country in the world will show a general overview of the country, and graphs relating to happiness, life expectancy, etc. Logged in users will be able to set a country as their favorite which will also set their profile picture as the flag of their country. They may also choose to favorite a specific chart, which will become viewable in their collection in their account profile. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">JOY ACROSS BORDERS 🔥🔥😵‍💫</mark>  collections are public. Users will also be able to leave ratings on each country based on factors that are up to their personal discretion, allowing for users to look beyond the numbers and see what fellow humans have to say about each piece of land.
